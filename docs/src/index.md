# SyntheticLikelihood
Documentation for SyntheticLikelihood package. The package is currently a work in progress. Simulator functions should take a single positional argument which is a vector of parameters (and can have arbitrary key word arguments). Summary functions should take the output from the simulator directly as a single positional argument (and can have arbitrary key word arguments).
